# Dark Theme Simplicity - Critical Error Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Circular Dependency in Customizer Files
- **Problem**: `customizer-setup.php` was attempting to include `customizer.php` which created a circular dependency.
- **Fix**: Removed the circular include and ensured files are loaded in the correct order in `functions.php`.

### 2. Duplicate Function Definitions
- **Problem**: `dark_theme_simplicity_sanitize_checkbox` was defined in both `customizer-setup.php` and `customizer.php`.
- **Fix**: Added a `function_exists()` check in `customizer.php` to prevent redefinition.

### 3. Incorrect Loading Order
- **Problem**: `customizer-setup.php` defines functions that are used by `customizer.php` but was not being loaded first.
- **Fix**: Updated `functions.php` to explicitly include `customizer.php` after `customizer-setup.php`.

### 4. Sanitize Function Definition Location
- **Problem**: `dark_theme_simplicity_sanitize_yes_no` function was defined at the end of the file but used earlier.
- **Fix**: Moved the function definition to the top of `customizer-setup.php` to ensure it's available when needed.

## Files Modified

1. `inc/customizer-setup.php`
   - Moved sanitize functions to the top of the file
   - Removed circular dependency include
   - Added proper function_exists() checks

2. `inc/customizer.php`
   - Added function_exists() check for sanitize_checkbox function
   - Fixed other potential sanitize function conflicts

3. `functions.php`
   - Updated to explicitly include customizer.php after customizer-setup.php

## Debugging Tools Created

1. `wp-debug-config.php` - Enables enhanced WordPress debugging
2. `function-duplicate-checker.php` - Scans theme files for duplicate function definitions

## Installation Instructions

1. Copy the fixed files to your theme directory
2. Optional: For debugging, add this to wp-config.php before "That's all, stop editing!":
   ```php
   require_once(__DIR__ . '/wp-debug-config.php');
   ```

## Verification

The following tests were performed to verify the fixes:
- Syntax check on all modified files
- Duplicate function check to ensure no conflicts remain
- File encoding check to ensure no BOM or whitespace issues

All critical errors have been resolved, and the WordPress Customizer and other theme functionality should now work properly.
